"""
OCR/board detection stub.
In a full implementation this module would use OpenCV to detect the board, segment squares
and use pytesseract or a CNN to identify pieces.
run detection on-device with a lightweight model or call a backend.

This stub attempts to import OpenCV/pytesseract and falls back to a mock FEN.
